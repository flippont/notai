<p>People lived in a feudal system in the Middle Ages, meaning that the social hierarchy was very strict with most of
    the population being peasants. Houses for peasants were made of wood, and towns imposed <strong>curfews</strong>,
    which meant that people had to extinguish fires at sundown.</p>
<p>The craftsmen of each town set up <strong>guilds</strong>, which was an organisation of people working for the same
    trade/skill. Apprentices who worked for a master craftsman had to create a <strong>masterpiece</strong> to seek
    approval from a guild to see if he was worthy to be a master craftsman.</p>
<p>Religion was central in peoples lives and the Pope was Europe’s most powerful ruler. Europe was often called
    <strong>Christendom</strong>. Bishops and monasteries became very wealthy. A monk had to live his life according to
    the <strong>Rule of St Benedict</strong>, which was the strict set of rules he had to live by. Some monks called
    <strong>friars</strong> lived among people to help them. Churches had two types. <strong>Romanesque</strong> and
    <strong>Gothic</strong>. Gothic churches had larger windows, higher ceilings and narrower pillars when compared to
    the Romanesque one.<br /> Becoming a knight was difficult and you followed these steps</p>

<p>A town needed a charter from the king, a contract where the town was granted freedom to run its own affairs.</p>
<p>A manor usually had a mill, blacksmith and a house for the <strong>bailiff</strong> – the man who ruled instead of
    the lord, to collect taxes and keeping the law/order.</p>
<p>People used an <strong>open field system</strong> for farming, which meant that the land for crops were separated
    into three fields. They left one field <strong>fallow</strong>, empty for one year so that the soil could recover
    its nutrients. A fourth filed was called <strong>the commons</strong>, where they grazed animals. Freemen, which was
    a form of peasant had to pay a <strong>tithe</strong> to the priest, which was 10% of their income. Serfs, which
    were another form of peasants, which were practically owned by their lord, and only had rights to own a small piece
    of land to farm and build a house on.</p>
