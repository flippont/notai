<p>The renaissance was a Golden age in History that started in Italy. Many inventions and different inventions were made
    during this period. Here are the causes of the Renaissance.</p>
<li><strong>The Ruins of the Roman Empire</strong><br /> People had easy access to ancient works from the Roman times,
    and especially in Italy, since the language is based off of Latin, the official language of Rome, people could
    understand ancient texts and achievements of their ancestors</li>
<li><strong>The Fall of Constantinople<br /> </strong>Constantinople fell in 1453, meaning that a lot of Greek scholars
    fled into Italy, which made ancient Greek and Roman manuscripts from the ancient world spread into Italy.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth<br /> </strong>Italy’s geographical positioning in the Mediterranean, meant that it accumulated a lot
    of wealth over the years that could be spent on art and architecture.</li>
<li><strong>New Ideas<br /> </strong>Different ideas on mathematics spread from the east into Italy with the trade route
    they had.</li>
<li><strong>Patrons<br /> </strong>A <strong>patron</strong> is a wealthy person that commissioned artists to make art
    for them. There was a high demand for good art because of the large amount of wealthy people that wanted to display
    their wealth in a physical form, which lead to there being more competition among artists.</li>
<li><strong>Competition<br /> </strong>Italy was divided into smaller city states back then, which meant different
    states will compare on their artistic/scientific advancements. A good example of this is Florence. Florence was the
    wealthiest city in Italy, and was ruled by the <strong>de Medici</strong> family, within the family, <strong>Lorenzo
        de Medici</strong> spent almost all of their family savings on sponsoring artists.</li>
<p>Changes in Art</p>
<p>Different ways to tackle hyper-realism in art was developed during the Renaissance, like <strong>Sfumato</strong>,
    which is a unique way to blur/smudge lines to add shadows, and <strong>perspective</strong>, which added depth to
    the paintings. <strong>Anatomy</strong> advanced during this era, which meant that people understood the human body
    better. People drew on canvases, or with wet wax on walls, which was called <strong>fresco</strong>.</p>
<h2>Discoveries</h2>
<p>People during this time began to question the commonly accepted beliefs from the Middle Ages, and they made many
    important discoveries in the fields of medicine and science. Some of the achievements of this time are</p>
<li><strong>Galileo Galilei</strong> proved that the Earth orbited around the sun based off of Copernicus’s work, which
    brought conflict with the Catholic Church and was convicted of <strong>heresy</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>William Harvey</strong> discovered circulation - that the heart pumped blood around the body</li>
<li><strong>Ambroise Par</strong><strong>é</strong> discovered ointment, an effective way to treat germs</li>
<p>Inventions<strong><br /> The printing press</strong> was the single most important invention during the Renaissance,
    invented by Gutenberg. This meant that books could be cheaply bought, which lead to more people learning how to
    read/write. The public was introduced to different ideas, and people started to read for entertainment. The use of
    Latin declined, as books began to be written in the <strong>vernacular</strong>. Ideas like
    <strong>Humanism</strong>, also spread where human beings are at the centre of everything.</p>
