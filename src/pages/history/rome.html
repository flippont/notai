<p>Rome was the most powerful empire in the ancient world, and it arose from a cluster of small villages on the Tiber.
</p>
<p>There were patricians and plebians in Roman society. Patricians were wealthy and lived in a <strong>domus</strong>
    and owned many slaves. When a slave was freed after years of service, it was called <strong>Manumission</strong>. A
    domus has a wide variety of rooms, for example…</p>
<li><strong>The Atrium</strong><br /> Where the guests met</li>
<li><strong>Impulvium<br /> </strong>Pool that collected rainwater</li>
<li><strong>Lalarium<br /> </strong>A shrine to the family Gods.</li>
<p>Plebians on the other hand, had a poorer lifestyle and lived in an <strong>insulae</strong>. They made up the
    majority of the population. They were paid with the <strong>Dole</strong>, which was free grain.</p>
<p>Romans enjoyed many forms of entertainment, like public baths, gladiator fights, theatre and chariot racing. In a
    typical Roman public bath, they would have a <strong>frigidarium</strong> which was the cold-water bath, the
    <strong>tepidarium</strong>, a medium heat room and a <strong>caldarium</strong> which was a hot room, much like a
    sauna.</p>
<p>In the Roman army, men signed up for 25 years to fight. Individual soldiers were called <strong>legionaries</strong>
    and together they made up a legion. The soldiers were not only employed to fight, but they often built public
    infrastructure like aqueducts and roads.</p>
<p>The Romans believed in a multitude of different Gods as they were pagan. Christianity was initially persecuted by the
    Romans, until it became the official religion of Rome.</p>
<p>Although Rome has made achievements that still exist in our society, like the calendar, and Rome became the
    foundation of Western society, Rome’s success was built on conquest and slavery.</p>
