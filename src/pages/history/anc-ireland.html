    The <strong>stone</strong>, (Mesolithic and Neolithic periods) and <strong>bronze age</strong> are the prehistoric
    (before recorded history) eras of Ireland. The Iron age had a writing system called “<strong>Ogham</strong>”.

    The first people arrived in Ireland during the Mesolithic era. They were hunter-gatherers who used stone weapons and
    tools. They moved as the heard of prey moved, and cremated their dead. <br />
    During the Neolithic period, they started farming, and they no-longer had a need for living nomadic lives and
    started living in permanent houses
    (which were made of <strong>wattle and daub</strong>, sticks woven together and covered with a mixture of mud, dung,
    sand and straw) , farmed crops and reared animals for food. They built tombs for the dead, known as passage tombs,
    portal dolmens and court cairns.

    In the Bronze age, metal tools and weapons became common. People lived in larger houses and graves became smaller.

    The Iron Age brought the Celts to Ireland. They were much more organized, with a proper social hierarchy. Their
    culture and systems dominated until the arrival of Christianity in Ireland.
