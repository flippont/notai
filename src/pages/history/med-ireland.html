<p>The Middle Ages in Ireland had a lot of conflict, as the Vikings and the Normans came into Ireland and had a huge
    impact.<br /> The Vikings raided Irish monasteries in the 790s. From the 840s they were building settlements along
    the coasts and rivers. Dublin was the largest settlement.</p>
<p>In 1169, the Normans invaded to restore the former king of Leinster, Dermot MacMurrough. They defeated the Vikings
    and the Gaelic Irish, and tried to conquer the rest of the country. The Normans built castles and towns and
    introduced the English <strong>common laws</strong> to replace the Irish <strong>Brehon laws</strong> and family
    names into Ireland. Dublin Castle was the centre of Dublinâ€™s life, and the area around Dublin became known as
    <strong>the Pale</strong>, and it was under direct control of the English King. The Normas that adopted into Irish
    cultures and married into Irish families became known as the <strong>Anglo-Irish</strong>.</p>
