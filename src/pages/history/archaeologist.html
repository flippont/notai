<p>An archaeologist studies the remains left by people in the past. When an archaeologist digs the remains up left by
    people in the past is known as an <strong>excavation</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are different skills and methods used by archaeologists.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Geophysical Surveying</strong><br /> Taking an X-ray of the ground to see what is under the ground
        without
        excavation
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Pollen Analysis</strong><br /> You can see what was growing at a certain time period by looking at
        pollen
        remains. You compare the pollen found, with a list of what type of pollen was common in a certain era, you can
        get a
        rough estimate of the period when a nearby forest was cleared / when farming began.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Carbon-14 dating (Radio-carbon dating)</strong><br /> Due to the short half life of carbon-14, if you
        measure the amount of carbon-14 in an artefact you can see how old it is. Every living thing contains carbon-14,
        so
        if you take any dead animal/plant, you can see how old it is.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Stratigraphy</strong><br /> Stratigraphy dates artefacts based on how deep underground the artefact was
        found in. The deeper they are, the older they will be since a small amount of soil covers up that location over
        time. The layers of soil is called <strong>strata</strong>, hence the name “stratigraphy”.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Dendrochronology<br /> </strong>Dendrochronology is a method of dating that uses the growth patterns of
        tree
        rings as a guide to see how old a tree is.
    </li>
