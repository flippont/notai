<p>Early Christian Ireland was the period when Christianity first came to Ireland from a bishop named Palladius in AD
    431. Before this, people in Ireland were <strong>pagan</strong> meaning that they believed in more than one God. The
    most famous bishop to travel to Ireland was St. Patrick who was in Ireland between AD 432 and AD 461.</p>
<p>Many monasteries were built from sixth century and on (E.g., Inis Mór - The First ever monastery founded in Ireland
    by St Enda, Clonard, Kells, Clonmacnoise, Glendalough, Sceilig Mhichil).</p>
<p>There are a lot of different types of monastery buildings. Here is a list of the different types.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Beehive Hut</strong><br /> Small stone huts shaped like a beehive, where monks slept.</li>
    <li><strong>Oratories</strong><br /> Where the monk attended mass or prayed</li>
    <li><strong>Scriptorium<br /> </strong>Where manuscripts were copied by hand and illustrated</li>
    <li><strong>Refectory<br /> </strong>Where monks ate their meals</li>
    <li><strong>Round tower<br /> </strong>A safe place for people and treasure when the monastery was under attack</li>
</ul>
<p>A large variety of art was created by the monks. They included chalices, brooches, cups and crosses. They decorated
    each object with gold <strong>filigree work</strong> and enamel. A good example of an art piece from this time is
    <strong>Ardagh Chalice</strong> is a chalice in the National Museum of Ireland.
