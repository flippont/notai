Dear Aunt Clara</br>
I’m writing here from the barn. It’s a hell of a place here. The Salinas river flows right close.</br>
The grass is as green as it gets, the trees, the willows, everything is fresh and perfect as they should be. It’s like stepping into some vivid childhood memory of min, when everything used to be just good. Real good.</br>
No worries, no fears, nothing. But life ‘aint that easy when you’ve all grown up.</br>
Everything has changed a ton since you moved on. That nephew of yours has really been pulling on my foot. It wasn’t even last week when we had our last fight.</br>
</br>
He, He never learns. Lennie. He always remembers stuff that only benefits him and nothing else. Like mice, and rabbits, and that god damn leather pouch you gave him. I’m real worried. I really am. If Lennie makes a big mistake like last time, we don’t have no more places to go. This is our last resort, so I do sure hope Lennie can settle in good, and cause no harm.</br>
To change the topic, our bunkhouse is real bland. It don’t feel like no home to me. White walls, white floors, white everything. It’s like a god-damn prison out here. No cosyness or nothing even though plenty of men live here.</br>
To say the least, our welcoming to the bunk wasn’t warm. There’s this real kind guy named Candy. He’s ‘bout as crooked as a man can get, but he has a pure heart and he really means the best for both of us. He gave us a little tour around the place.</br>
Our boss is a man with good meaning. He got real mad at us for being late for our shift though. That was that darn driver’s fault! I tried to explain but it was no good to him. He is the boss after all. </br>
I tried to avoid Lennie to talk as much as possible in front of the boss, ‘cause I really wanted the job. When the boss asked about him, I made up a pretty childish lie. I’m real sorry about that Aunt Clara. I really am.</br>
We were introduced to another guy that day. He was called Curley. I’ve only seen him for a while, but I already have bad feelings ‘bout him.</br>
</br>
I want to end the letter with a note. Lennie, sure he can be a bit of a weight, but he sure is a kind hearted guy. And if anything were to happen to him, I sure am prepared to take responsibility</br>
Yours truly, George Milton.
