<h2>★ Act 2 Scene 2 - The Balcony Scene</h2>
<div>
Romeo risks his life to see Juliet at her balcony, whilst describing her beauty in a soliloquy. He
describes Juliet as “the sun”. Juliet thinks about Romeo in a soliloquy, and thinks about the
relevance of his name and who he is. She quotes, “Wherefore art thou Romeo, deny thy father, or
refuse thy name.” Romeo interjects her soliloquy and they both have a conversation about love and
later, marriage. The Nurse disrupts this as she repeatedly calls Juliet to come in. The scene ends
with Romeo and Juliet agreeing to marry the next day.</br>
This heightens the drama as Romeo and Juliet are both from feuding families. By them having a
relationship with one another major events to happen, for example, it causes Romeo to be banished
to Mantua, the death of Lady Montague and Paris, the staged death of Juliet, and eventual suicides
of Romeo and Juliet.

<h2>★ Act 3 Scene 1- The Fight Scene</h2>
<div>
As they walk in the street under the boiling sun, Benvolio suggests to Mercutio that they go indoors,
fearing that a brawl will be unavoidable should they encounter Capulet men. Tybalt enters with a
group of cronies. He approaches Benvolio and Mercutio and asks to speak with one of them.
Annoyed, Mercutio begins to taunt and provoke him. Romeo enters. Tybalt turns his attention from
Mercutio to Romeo, and calls Romeo a villain. Romeo, now secretly married to Juliet and thus
Tybalt’s kinsman, refuses to be angered by Tybalt’s verbal attack. Tybalt commands Romeo to draw
his sword. Romeo protests that he has good reason to love Tybalt, and does not wish to fight him.
Mercutio angrily draws his sword and declares with biting wit that if Romeo will not fight Tybalt,
he will. Mercutio and Tybalt begin to fight. Romeo, attempting to restore peace, throws himself
between the combatants. Tybalt stabs Mercutio under Romeo’s arm, and as Mercutio falls, Tybalt
and his men hurry away. Mercutio dies, cursing both the Montagues and the Capulets: “A plague o’
both your houses”. Enraged, Romeo declares that his love for Juliet “hath made him effeminate”,
and that he should have fought Tybalt in Mercutio’s place. When Tybalt, still angry, storms back
onto the scene, Romeo draws his sword. They fight, and Romeo kills Tybalt. Romeo, shocked at what
has happened, cries “O, I am fortune’s fool!” and flees.</br>
This heightens the drama and shows that the theme of conflict is present in the play. The feud
between the Capulets and Montagues is the primary cause of this drama and deaths to occur. If
there wasn't this rivalry, Romeo and Juliet’s relationship would have not been a secret and end up
with both of them dead. After Tybalt was killed, it caused Romeo to flee to Mantua, which caused
Friar Lawrence to devise a plan for Romeo and Juliet to run away together. This plan eventually
caused the deaths or the “star crossed lovers.” Towards the end of the play, this conflict is resolved
when Prince Escalus stops the rivalry between Montagues and Capulets.

<h2>★ Act 3 Scene 5 - Capulet’s Father arranges marriage with County Paris</h2>
<div>
Juliet’s father, Lord Capulet reveals that he has arranged Juliet’s marriage to the County Paris. This
heightens the drama in the play because Capulet was not aware that Juliet was already married to
the son of his enemy, a Romeo Montague. This moment also increases the amount of conflict and
tension in the play because Juliet reacts strongly to this and tells him “Not proud you have, but
thankful that you have, but i can be thankful for something that i hate, if it was meant with love.”
Her reaction heightens the drama because it was unexpected of her to react in such a manner.
During this period, women were expected to obey their husbands and fathers. It shows that she is
no longer the obedient and innocent girl that we were introduced to at the beginning, and that she
has chosen to be loyal to Romeo. Juliet is openly defying Capulet and being “ungrateful” in Capulet’s
point of view. This defiance provokes Lord Capulet's furious reaction. He tells Juliet that he will
disown her if she doesn't marry Paris. Capulet loses control and insults Juliet by calling her a
“young baggage, disobedient wrench,” and strikes her.

<h2>★ Act 5 Scene 3 - The Final Scene</h2>
<div>
In the churchyard, Paris scatters flowers on Juliet’s grave. He sees Romeo, carrying a crowbar, who
enters with Balthasar and orders him to leave. Balthasar lingers to watch.</br>
From Paris’ hiding place, he recognizes Romeo as the man who has been exiled from the city on
penalty of death, Paris thinks that Romeo must hate the Capulets so much that he has returned to
the tomb to do some dishonor to the corpse of either Tybalt or Juliet. In a rage, Paris accosts Romeo.
Romeo pleads with him to leave, but Paris refuses. They draw their swords and fight. Paris’s page
runs off to get the civil watch. Romeo kills Paris. As he dies, Paris asks to be laid near Juliet in the
tomb, and Romeo consents.</br>
Romeo finds Juliet lying peacefully, and wonders how she can still look so beautiful—as if she were
not dead at all. Romeo speaks to Juliet of his intention to spend eternity with her, describing himself
as shaking “the yoke of inauspicious stars. He kisses Juliet, drinks the poison, kisses Juliet again,
amd says “Thus with a kiss, I die.” and dies.
Friar Lawrence enters the churchyard and encounters Balthasar; who tells him that Romeo is in the
tomb. The friar enters the tomb, where he finds Paris’s body and then Romeo’s, as Juliet wakes and
asks where her husband is.</br>
The Friar tells her that both Romeo and Paris are dead, and that she must leave with him. Juliet
refuses to leave, and the friar, fearful that the watch is imminent, exits without her. Juliet sees
Romeo dead beside her, and surmises from the empty vial that he has drunk poison. Hoping she
might die by the same poison, Juliet kisses his lips, but to no avail. Hearing the approaching watch,
Juliet unsheathes Romeo’s dagger and, saying, “This is thy sheath, there rust and let me die.” and
stabs herself.</br>
Paris’s page has brought the watch. The Prince and the Capulets enter. Romeo, Juliet, and Paris are
discovered in the tomb. Montague arrives, declaring that Lady Montague has died of grief for
Romeo’s exile. The Prince shows Montague his son’s body. Upon the Prince’s request, Friar
Lawrence succinctly tells the story of Romeo and Juliet’s secret marriage and its consequences.
Balthasar gives the Prince the letter Romeo had previously written to his father. The Prince says
that it confirms the friar’s story. He scolds the Capulets and Montagues, calling the tragedy a
consequence of their feud and reminding them that he himself has lost two close kinsmen:</br>
Mercutio and Paris. Capulet and Montague clasp hands and agree to put their vendetta behind
them. The Prince takes the group away to discuss these events, pronouncing that there has never
been “a story of more woe, than this of Juliet and her Romeo”</br>
This resolves the existing conflict between Capulets and Montagues.
