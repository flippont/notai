<h2>Who is Juliet?</h2>
<div>
Juliet is the daughter of Lord and Lady Capulet who is stuck in the middle of a family feud - and</br>
even more so, when she falls in love with her ‘loathed enemy’s’ son. In a short period of 3 days, she</br>
falls in love with Romeo Montague and spends the next few days sorting out the lies she told her</br>
parents, such as getting married in secret, faking her death to run away with Romeo and then</br>
finally killing herself as a proclamation of her love to Romeo and that she cannot live without him.</br>
</div>
<h2>Traits</h2>
<div>
    ❖ Naïve</br>
    ❖ Innocent</br>
    ❖ Gullible</br>
    ❖ Determined</br>
    ❖ Passionate</br>
    ❖ Accepting</br>
    </br>
    At first, Juliet is presented as a young naïve girl who is obedient to her parents.
    <div class="quote">- “Marriage as an honour that I do not dream of”</div>
    When the idea of marriage to Paris is placed before her, she acquiesces, saying:
    <div class="quote"> - “I’ll look to like, if looking liking move.”</br></br>
    “Parting is such a sweet sorrow”</div>
    Juliet talks to a Romeo in Act 2 Scene 2, just before he leaves her. She shows that she is innocent and
    young and has no experience in love and falls in love easily. Juliet doesn't think that there are
    repercussions to her actions, all she can think about is herself and Romeo.
    <div class="quote">“It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden.”</div>
    Juliet shows maturity when she hesitates to marry Romeo. She is still young but she shows that she</br>
    know what could happen if they were married.
    <div class="quote">“That which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet.”</div>
    Juliet is an accepting person, who doesn't care what someone's name is or how they look like - 
    this shows how deep she has fallen in love with Romeo and how quick she is to do so.</br>
    </br>
    However, Juliet surprises the reader in a number of ways:</br>
    ★ Although she had just told her parents that she was not thinking of marriage at all, she
    quickly falls for Romeo and agrees to marry him. She falls for Romeo even though she swore
    she could never love a Montague.</br>
    ○ “ My only love sprung from my only hate.”</br>
    ○ “Prodigious birth of love it is to me, that I must love a loathed enemy.”</br>
    ★ “Be but sworn my love and I’ll no longer be a Capulet.” Juliet shows her true feelings for her
    family and Romeo. She shows that she thinks little of her mother and father and thinks
    much of a Romeo. She declares that Romeo has to say he loves her and she will leave
    everything behind.</br>
    ★ She stands up for herself and refuses to marry Paris, incurring her father’s anger. He
    threatens that he will disown her if she doesn't marry Paris. She willingly trades loyalty to
    her family for loyalty to Romeo - she will not betray Romeo by committing bigamy. She
    seems to have abandoned the obedient and innocent traits that she had in Act 1.</br>
    ○ “An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets”</br>
    ★ These are very surprising changes to occur in any character, but are especially surprising
    and mature for a thirteen year old.

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<div>
    Juliet is affected by many challenges throughout the play. This is due to the family feuds between
    the Montagues and Capulets, her father's need to control her life and her own character
    development throughout the play.</br>
    <div class="quote">“My only love sprung from my only hate.”</div>
    Juliet is confused by who she loves. She needs to choose who she wants to be with. Should she
    betray her family and be with Romeo? Or should he stay with her father and mother but, deny
    Romeo’s love? This matures her into making impulsive decisions that abandons her obedience and
    innocence; which leads her to her fated death.</br>
    “An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets.” When Juliet chooses Romeo over her family
    (unbeknownst to them), her father reacts badly as he wants to control Juliet. He cares more about
    his image than his daughter. At that time, it is normal for men having power and authority over
    their wives and daughters, and therefore, when Juliet fights back, he threatens that he will disown
    her if she doesn't marry Paris.</br>
    <div class="quote">“What is it be a poison which the Friar subtly hath ministered to have me dead.”</div>
    Juliet faces the decision of taking a strange potion that Friar Lawrence had given her. This is part of
    her plan to be with Romeo. In her soliloquy, she weighs her choice wisely. She knows that she could
    be disowned for what she has done, however, she is scared that the potion could not work or work
    to well and kill her.</br>
</div>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<div>
<div class="quote">
“It is the east and Juliet is the sun.”
</div>
    Romeo and Juliet fall in love at first sight. They don't know each other's names yet, but they are sure
    that they are the one. Here, Romeo compares Juliet to the sun - the light of his life that he cannot
    live without.</br>
    <div class="quote">
    “Thou was the prettiest babe I e’er nursed.
    </div>
    Juliet has a close relationship with the nurse. She is a trusted confidant and is much closer to her
    than her own mother. Juliet trusts the a Nurse about her relationship with Romeo.
