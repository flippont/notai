<h2>Intro</h2>
<div>
    The title comes from the Robert Burns poem, To a Mouse​
    ​
    <div class="quote" style="background: lightblue;">
        The best laid schemes o’ Mice an’ Men​</br>

            Gang aft agley,​</br>

        An’ lea’e us nought but grief an’ pain,​</br>

            For promis’d joy!​</br>
    </div>

        ​
    This can translate into: 
    ​
    <div class="quote" style="background: lightpink;">

    The plans made by mice and men​</br>

    Often go awry​</br>

    And leave us with nothing but grief and pain​</br>

    Instead of happiness​</br>

<h2>Background</h2>

    Of Mice and Men follows the story of two friends, Lennie and George, as they seek work in order to achieve their simple dream of having their own farm. ​</br>
    It is set  in 1930s America. During this time, America was suffering from ‘The Great Depression’ - a period of high unemployment and high cost of living. People travelled across America in search of jobs. These people were called migrant workers, and often worked for very poor wages in difficult conditions.​
