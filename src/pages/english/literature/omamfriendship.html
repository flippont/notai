<h2>The theme of friendship</h2>
<div>
    The friendship of Lennie and George is one of the driving forces of the novel. </br>​
    </br>
    They are unlikely friends, as they are entirely different, but they depend on each in different ways and look out for each other.     George and Lennie recognise that they are different because they have each other and understand that this is very important for them.​
    </br>
    </br>
    Evidence: ​
    <div class="quote">
        “But not us! An’ why? Because... because I got you to look after me, and you got me to look after you, and that’s why”. ​
    </div>
    The way that Lennie repeats this sentence to George demonstrates that he has learnt it through saying it many times, as he cuts George off to complete this mantra. Even though George sometimes gets annoyed with Lennie, their friendship is the most important thing in both of their lives and it means that they protect each other.

<h2>Why is friendship a crucial theme in Of Mice and Men? </h2>
<div>
    Steinbeck shows us that, in the bleak and miserable time of the Great Depression, the thing which provides real and genuine joy is friendship. ​</br>
    </br>
    Many of the characters in this novel are chasing The American Dream, or are hoping for a better life. However, we see through the course of the novel that dreams can fade, and do not also come to fruition. However, friendship remains something that can bring real happiness, as each is looking out for the other, not just themselves. ​

<h2>Key Quotes</h2>
<div>
    <div class="quote">
        “Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the world. They got no family. They don’t belong no place. . . . With us it ain’t like that. We got a future. We got somebody to talk to that gives a damn about us. We don’t have to sit in no bar room blowin’ in our jack jus’ because we got no place else to go. If them other guys gets in jail they can rot for all anybody gives a damn. But not us.”​

<h2>Expressing their Friendship​</h2>
<div>
    George and Lennie have unique ways of showing their friendship. Early in the novel, we see this exchange: ​

    ​
    <div class="quote" style="background: lightpink;">
    Lennie: “I was only foolin’, George. I don’t want no ketchup. I wouldn’t eat no ketchup if it was right here beside me.”​
    </div>
    <div class="quote" style="background: lightblue;">
    George: “If it was here, you could have some.”​
    </div>
    <div class="quote" style="background: lightpink;">
    Lennie: “But I wouldn’t eat none, George. I’d leave it all for you. You could cover your beans with it and I wouldn’t touch none of it.”​
