<h2>Background</h2>
<div>
    William Butler Yeats was an Anglo-Irish poet born in
    1965. Although he grew up mostly in England, he was
    fascinated by Ireland, its culture and its writing. He had
    spent his summers as a child in Sligo, and it is there
    that he is buried today. At the time of Yeats’ growing
    up, Ireland was still under English rule and had lost a
    great deal of its culture due to English occupation.
    Yeats was a leading force of the Irish Revival, which
    encouraged an interest in the Irish language, history,
    literature, arts and drama. He co-founded the Abbey
    theatre, with the goal of performing Irish plays by Irish
    actors.</br>
    In his poetry, Yeats oen focuses on two themes: the
    beauty of nature, and magic. In this poem, we see his
    admiration for the beauty of Ireland, written in lyrical
    and delicate language. Yeats wrote this poem in his late
    twenties, when he was feeling tired with London life,
    and was longing to return to the Irish countryside. In
    ‘The Lake Isle of Innisfree’, he idealises the
    countryside, and builds up in his mind a fantasy for
    himself, where he is one with nature, and lives a
    care-free, uninterrupted life.

<h2>Theme:</h2>
<div>
    The theme of this poem is peace and nature. Yeats
    finds strength in even just the thought of returning to

    Innisfree. We see that he is tired with dreary London
    life, which he describes in the simple sentence: “While
    I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey.” We
    see the juxtaposition of the colourless, dull city life,
    and the vibrancy and beauty of Innisfree. He writes
    that “I shall have some peace there, for peace comes
    dropping slow.” This line would suggest that it is here,
    and here only that he can revive himself, and live a
    solitary, quiet life in the Irish countryside.
</div>
<h2>Language</h2>
<div>
    The language in this poem is delicate, sensual and
    striking. This can be seen when he writes: “Dropping
    from the veils of the morning to where the cricket
    sings.” In this line, Yeats uses figurative language to
    help to add to the idealistic quality of Innisfree. He
    uses several poetic techniques throughout this poem
    (see below) in order to create a rich and vivid
    landscape. For example, “veils of the morning” uses
    personification, which adds to the sense of mysterious
    beauty of the place.

<h2>Tone:</h2>
<div>
    The tone of this poem is peaceful, but also decisive.
    This can be seen in the repetition of the line “I will
    arise and go now.” It is not merely that Yeats is
    imagining the Sligo of his childhood, it is that he is
    making the decision to return.</br>
    The peaceful tone of the poem is evoked through the
    imagery of nature, and the illustrations of a quiet,
    peaceful life. He writes, “And I shall have some peace
    there, for peace comes dropping slow.” We have here
    the theme of peace and tranquillity, but also the
    decisive tone reappears when he says “I shall have”: it
    seems he has already made up his mind, and he will
    indeed live out this quiet, peaceful life.
    It could also be said that there is a yearnful tone used
    in this poem. Yeats writes that “Always night and day… I
    hear it in the deep heart’s core.” He is suggesting that it
    is his very dearest wish, that no matter what he is
    doing, or where he is, he yearns for Innisfree.

<h2>Techniques:</h2>
<div>
    This poem is filled with fantastic techniques used to
    the very highest standard. Here are some of the best
    techniques in this poem, as well as their effect.
    <ul>
        <li>
            Lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore: this
            use of alliteration mimics the lapping motion of
            the water, wonderfully evoking the Isle, and
            creating a calming, lullaby-like effect.
        </li>
        <li>
            Midnight’s all a glimmer and noon a purple glow: the
            first half of this line uses assonance on the ‘I’, and
            thus creates a light sound. This is contrasted with
            the flatter sounds of the second half, which uses
            the broader sound of ‘o’ and ‘u’: this contrast of
            assonance is evoking the contrast between
            midnight and noon.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dropping from the veils of the morning/I hear it in the
            deep heart’s core: this use of personification gives
            life to the landscape, and makes it even more
            vivid.
        </li>
        <li>
            While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements
            grey: this uses in-line rhyme to create a
            monotonous feel, a steady, predictable rhythm,
            such as that he is used to in London.
        </li>
    </ul>
