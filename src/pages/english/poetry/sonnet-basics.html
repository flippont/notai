<h2>Modern-English Translation</h2>

    <div class="quote">
        Will I compare you to a summer’s day?
        You are lovelier and steadier
        Sometimes storms will ruin a summer’s day
        Sometimes it’s too hot
        And the next minute the sun is gone
        Summer will eventually change into something else
        Things change, whether it’s nature or chance
        But you will stay perfect
        You’ll never lose your beauty
        When you die, death will find no joy in in/Your beauty is
        deathless (Two possible meanings here)
        You will live forever in poetry
        As long as this poem is read
        You too will live.

<h2>Bite-sized Summary</h2>

    summer’s day, as his beauty will never die. As long as
    this poem is read, his beauty will live forever.

    Celebrating a beauty that will last forever.
    What’s the main technique?
    Extended metaphor: comparing the muse to a
    summer’s day.
    What’s an important image?
    The image of winds shaking a tree in summer: “Rough

    “So long as men can breathe or eyes can see
    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.”

    muse will live forever through this poem: a summer’s
    day will end, but he will live as long as the poem is
    read.
