<p>This, translated from Latin, means: "It is sweet and fitting to die for one's country."</p>
<h2>Theme:</h2>
<p>The theme of this poem is the trauma of war. Owen details the nature of war: the horrific conditions, the sudden terror that can arrive at any instance, and the guilt that one feels over the men who have been lost.</p>
<p>Owen was tired of hearing about the glory of war, and felt that not enough attention was being paid to the sheer, staggering terror that the soldiers felt, both during the war and after. Shell shock was a new concept at the time, and not widely understood, and so many men, such as Owen, suffered horrible hallucinations, insomnia, panic attacks and depression, without accurate treatment. The men who made it home from the war became known as the 'lost generation', as their lives when they came home was defined by extreme difficulty, both because of the impact of the war, as well as several more world-changing events which were to happen.</p>
<p>In order to change the conversation around the war, Owen tackles the theme of trauma with vivid, gruesome imagery, and an accusing tone. He specifically addresses the reader, saying</p>
<p>"If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood</p>
<p>Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs"</p>
<p>In this way, Owen is forcing the reader to reconsider what they know about war, and to take the word of an actual soldier who has seen truly terrible things.</p>
<h2>Tone:</h2>
<p>The tone of this poem changes in each stanza, a language technique which helps to engage the reader, as well as a way of echoing the unpredictability of war. In stanza one, the pace is slow, and the tone is low-spirited and depressed. The long, winding sentences mimic the trudging of the soldiers, and the mindlessness and fatigue is conveyed well in this manner. Such can be seen in "Men marched asleep." This use of alliteration recalls the monotonous manner of their marching, even as they march without purpose.</p>
<p>In stanza two, there is a sudden and dramatic change of pace, as mustard gas is released and the men must hurry to put on their helmets. This can be seen in "Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!" These four short words, and short impactful syllables echo the burst of gunfire, or the sudden drop of bombs. The use of punctuation here also helps to increase the sense of urgency and horror. The tone in this stanza is blind panic.</p>
<p>In the final two stanzas, we see the impact of the trauma, and the tone becomes mournful. This can be seen in</p>
<p>"In all my dreams before my helpless sight,</p>
<p>He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning".</p>
<p>The tone here is mournful, as he considers the loss of the man who was not fast enough to apply his mask.</p>
<p>In the final stanza, the tone is accusing: he addresses the reader specifically, and asks that children are not told of the glory of war and of soldiers. In the final lines, he recites the old Latin phrase, which he calls an 'old lie', that it is sweet and fitting to die for one's country. The tone here is ironic, and somewhat bitter,</p>
<p>as this is not at all what he means: he is resentful of this old bit of wisdom, and instead, rephrases it as a lie. </p>
<h2>Techniques:</h2>
<p>In this poem, Owen makes effective use of simile. The use of simile here is particularly effective, as there is an obvious desire to provide war to something terrible, as well as its effects, in order to fully convince the reader of its horrors. Such can be seen when he writes "Like a devil's sick of sin," and "Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud". These comparisons are to vile images, and closely associated with illness, which strongly conveys the sickening quality of trauma.</p>
<p>We see the use of cacophony in the first stanza of this poem, in the lines "Bent double, like old beggars under sacks, / Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge." The repetition of the 'k' sound, as well as words like 'sludge' and coughing', provide discordant sounds, and a general lack of flow. This brilliantly mimics the difficulty of movement which is described in this stanza, as well as the disorientation.</p>
<p>Another technique which is used to great effect here is alliteration. This can be seen in "And watch the white eyes writhing in his face". Here, Owen is drawing attention to the most disturbing image of the poem. The use of alliteration gives this line prominence in the poem, just as it holds a place of prominence in his memories.</p>
<p>- A further effective use of simile can be seen in the line "Coughing like hags." In comparing the soldiers to hags, we see a juxtaposition in the traditional idea of a soldier and the real, unfiltered soldier that Owen depicts. Traditionally, soldiers were seen as brave, strong and indeed the very height of masculinity. Here, however, Owen uses simile to compare the soldiers to old women, thus contrasting and challenging old ideas, such as we see in the Latin phrase from which the poem draws its title.</p>
