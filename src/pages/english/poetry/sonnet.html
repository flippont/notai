<h2>Background:</h2>
<p>This poem was written by William Shakespeare in praise of one of his muses, The Fair Youth. This takes the form of a
    sonnet, which is:</p>
<p><em>A 14-line poem ending in a rhyming couplet. </em></p>
<p>This is one of Shakespeare's 154 sonnets, and is believed to have been first published in 1609. This is perhaps
    Shakespeare's most famous sonnet and is still immensely popular several hundred years later. This is a poem of
    praise of the beauty of the muse, but can also be read as a love poem.</p>
<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>Shakespeare compares the subject of this poem to a summer's day. He states that although summer is beautiful,
    <strong>it is also inconsistent and changeable</strong>. By contrast, the Fair Youth is unchanging in his beauty and
    innocence. Most importantly, the comparison between a summer's day and the muse shows us that <strong>a
        summer's day, lovely though it is, has to end, while the beauty of the muse will live forever.</strong>
    This can be seen in the lines: "So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, / So long lives this, and this
    gives life to thee." Shakespeare states that as long as this poem is read, his muse will live forever. In this
    way, it could be argued that Shakespeare is praising himself as much as the Fair Youth; or perhaps he is suggesting
    that their lives are linked in such a manner: as long as Shakespeare lives, so too will his image of his muse.
</p>
<h2>Style:</h2>
<p>Sonnet 18 is written in <strong>archaic</strong> (old-fashioned) language and is highly <strong>stylised</strong>
    (stylish/fancy). It follows the rhyming scheme of abab cdcd efef gg (remember that a sonnet must end with two
    rhyming lines). The language is <strong>highly metaphorical and hyperbolic</strong>, showing the extremes of his
    regard for his muse.</p>
<p>Shakespeare's style is perhaps one of the most unique and recognisable styles in the English language. He is
    known for his <strong>extensive vocabulary, his incredible wordplay and his complexity</strong>. There are often
    many meanings to any one line, and it is often worth reading and rereading his lines to look for different meanings.
    For example, he states that a summer's day can sometimes lose its warmth and sunshine, describing it as
    "Often is his gold complexion dimm'd". Here, we see the use of personification, but we also see
    that he has given a summer's day a male pronoun ('his'). This is our biggest clue that this was
    written for the Fair Youth, while also providing a pretty comparison of a sun setting and a child losing their rosy
    glow.</p>
<p>This style is undeniably difficult, but also incredibly rewarding. To understand this poem is to engage with it: to
    see the meanings and deeper meanings, to understand its techniques and hidden messages. The language <strong>is
        complex, rich and entirely distinctive</strong>.</p>
<h2>Imagery:</h2>
<p>The most important imagery here is that of a summer's day. Although this is something we would associate with
    being lovely, Shakespeare highlights its flaws. <strong>He states that, compared to his muse, a summer's day
        is a disappointment</strong>. One particularly powerful image can be seen in the line "Rough winds do
    shake the darling buds of May": this line highlights that summer too has storms and rough weather, and the use
    of the word 'darling' engages the loving tone. He states that summer is not as perfect as we might
    think; even the idyllic trees of summer are weathered by storms.</p>
<h2>Tone:</h2>
<p>The tone is at first <strong>conversational</strong>, as we see in the line "Shall I compare thee to a
    summer' s day?" By opening his poem with this question to his muse, it seems almost as though we are
    interrupting a conversation between the poet and his muse, thus creating a <strong>sense of intimacy</strong>. As
    the poem continues, we see that it is a <strong>loving tone</strong>, and a <strong>tone of praise</strong>. He
    states that "Thy eternal summer shall not fade," and lavishes the muse with compliments. We see he has
    <strong>much admiration and perhaps love</strong> for the subject of this sonnet.
</p>
<h2>Techniques:</h2>
<p>This poem uses <strong>extended metaphor</strong> (comparing two things without using like, as or than over several
    lines). Throughout the course of the poem, he compares his muse to a summer's day. The result of this extended
    metaphor is a <strong>thoughtful, creative exploration of the Fair Youth's everlasting beauty.</strong> In the
    final two lines, we see the use of a <strong>rhyming couplet</strong>: "So long as men can breathe or eyes can
    see/ So long lives this, and this gives life to thee." The rhyming couplet gives a wonderfully
    <strong>euphonic</strong> end to an already sweetly flowing poem. He illustrates how as long as this poem is read,
    so too shall his muse. We see the use of <strong>personification</strong> several times throughout the poem. Such
    can be seen in "Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines." This gives a depth to his description of
    summer, allowing the reader to access a richer comparison between summer and the Fair Youth. <strong>Rhetorical
        question</strong> can be seen in the opening line: "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?"
    This creates a conversational tone and draws the reader in from the very start. It also helps with the flow of the
    poem: <strong>the natural response to a question is to anticipate an answer, and so the reader is anticipating the
        next line of the poem.</strong>
