<h2>Summary of the poem:</h2>
<div>
    The narrator of this poem is walking through the
    woods on a snowy evening. He stops there for a while
    and thinks of how lovely it is. He would like to stay
    there, but he has things to do, and must travel on.
</div>
<h2>Deeper Meaning?</h2>
<div>
    It’s very well to spend time doing nothing, admiring
    the world around you, but eventually you must get on
    with life, and fulfil your commitments.
</div>
<h2>What’s the point of this poem?</h2>
<div>
    The beauty of nature, and the ‘real world’ where you
    have to do the things you’ve promised.
</div>
<h2>What is Frost’s obsession with nature?</h2>
<div>
    Frost found that nature could mean many different
    things. Just as in ‘The Road Not Taken’, he used nature
    to represent two different choices in life, he uses
    nature here to describe the desire to hide away from
    commitments and responsibilities.
</div>
<h2>What’s the main technique?</h2>
<div>
    Euphony: the flow of poem as well as the
    sweet-sounding words capture the peace and beauty of
    the snow-covered woods: “The only other sound’s the
    shake/ Of easy wind and downy snow.”
</div>
<h2>Important image?</h2>
<div>
    The image of the woods, covered in snow. Frost
    captures its beauty, and we, like the reader, see the
    appeal of staying in such a place. He is alone, with only
    his horse for company, and there is no-one to trouble
    him: 
    <div class="quote">
        “He will not see me stopping here/ To watch his
        woods fill up with snow.”
    </div>
</div>
<h2>Important line?</h2>
<div>
    <div class="quote">
        “The woods are lovely, dark and deep /But I have
        promises to keep/ And miles to go before I sleep/ And
        miles to go before I sleep/”
    </div>
    This captures the desire to stay in the woods, away
    from people and problems and responsibilities: but he
    has to go on; has things to do before he can rest.
