<p>A function is a relationship between numbers, where if one number is changed, another will change alongside it.</p>
<p>For example, if you think about the relationship between days and hours, we can say that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1 day is 24 hours.</li>
    <li>2 days are 48 hours.</li>
    <li>3 days are 72 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, as the number of days change, the number of hours change alongside it.</p>
<p>Mathematically, this would be written as</p>
<p>y = 24 x, or f(x) = 24 x</p>
<p>where y or f(x) is the output, and x is the input. If we use the above example as a sample, x will represent the
    number of days and y or f(x) would represent the number of hours, since the number of hours is 24 times the number
    of days.</p>
<h2>Graphing Functions</h2>
<p>When you want graph a certain function, we plot multiple points that fit the function along the cartesian plane, and
    join the points together.</p>
<p>For example, for the function Y = 24 x</p>
<ul>
    <li>When x is 1, y is 24</li>
    <li>When x is 2, y is 48</li>
    <li>When x is 3 y is 72</li>
</ul>
<p>Etc etc..</p>
<p>Now we just plot the x and y co-ordinates on the plane and join the dots. There are online graphing calculators like
