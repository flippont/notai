<p>While you only do maths with positive numbers in primary school, once you get to secondary school, you will learn
    that there are <strong>numbers that are smaller than 0</strong>. For example, numbers like -1, -2 and -3 will be a
    number smaller than zero.</p>
<p>For those of you who can't really get how they work, they become easier to visualise when you think of the
    temperature. On a really cold winter day, the temperature will get below 0 and it will tell you that it is -7
    degrees. This means that it is "7 degrees colder than when it is 0 degrees outside".</p>
<h2>Addition with Negative numbers</h2>
<p>Now you know how negative numbers work, we must think about how we can add / subtract with these numbers. An easy way
    to understand this is think of it as movement on the <strong>number line</strong>. If the second number when adding
    two numbers (E.g., the <strong>6</strong> in -1 + 6) is a positive number, you move towards the right, and if it is
    a negative number, you move towards the left.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>First, let's try and calculate -1 plus 6. If you move 6 spaces to the right on the number line, you arrive at
    "5", so the answer to the answer to -1 plus 6 is going to be 5.</p>
<p>Next, let's try and calculate 2 plus -4. If you move 4 spaces to the left on the number line, you arrive at
    "-2", so the answer to the answer to 2 plus -4 is going to be -2.</p>
<h2>Subtraction with Negative numbers</h2>
<p>Like addition, subtraction with negative numbers is easy to understand using the number line. The only difference
    here is that the direction of the movement is reversed. In other words, when the second number is a positive number,
    you move to the left, and when it is a negative number, you move towards the right.</p>
<h3>More Examples</h3>
<p>Let's try and calculate 3 minus -5. If you move 5 steps to the right from 3, you get 8, thus making the answer
    to this sum 8.</p>
<h2>Multiplying / Dividing with Negative numbers</h2>
<p>All you need to do when multiplying negative numbers, is to add a minus only when one of the two numbers that you are
    trying to multiply is a negative number.</p>
<p>For example, 2 times -3 would be -6 because only the 3 has a minus, but -2 times -3 would be 6 because both numbers
    are negative.</p>
<p>The premise for dividing is the same as multiplying, where you add a minus only when one of the two numbers that you
    are trying to divide is a negative number.</p>
<p>For example, 12 divided by 6 is a 2, but 12 divided by -6 is a -2.</p>
