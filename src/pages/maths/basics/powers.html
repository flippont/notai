<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Powers are a simple way to write repeated multiplication using the same number.</p>
<p>When multiplying 2 four times you get 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 which is equal to 16.</p>
<p>In this case, the number you get after multiplying 2 four times is called "2 to the power of 4" and you write it as 2<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p>The 4 (The smaller digit) in this case is called the index or an exponent. The plural of index is indices. The 2 (The larger digit) is called the base.</p>
<p>When the index is 2, it is called squaring, and when the index is 3 it is called cubing.</p>
<h2>Roots</h2>
<p>√ (Roots) are numbers that have a square that is equal to the number.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>4<sup>2 </sup>is 16, so √16 is a 4.</p>
<p>5<sup>2 </sup>is 25, so √25 is a 5.</p>
<p>6<sup>2 </sup>is 36, so √36 is a 6.</p>
<p>These are easy to visualise when thinking them in terms of a physical square.</p>
<p>A square with an area of 16cm<sup>2 </sup>have side lengths of 4. This is the same as √16.</p>
