<p>A set is a collection of things. The “things” that make up a set is called an element. For example, if you had a
    fourth year hockey team with Paul, Peter, and Paula, they would be elements in the set for that fourth year hockey
    team. If you were to call this set A, set A would be written as:</p>
<p>A = {Paula, Paul, Peter}</p>
<p>Every element we treat in a certain question is called a universal set, which is written with the letter <em>U</em>.
</p>
<h2>Other Examples</h2>
<p>If you were to have a set of all prime numbers under 20, which you call C, you can write that as:</p>
<p>C = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19}</p>
<p>Now, if this was a set of all primes without limits, it would have an endless set of elements. This is called an
    infinite set.</p>
<h2>Key Terms</h2>
<p>There are a couple of key terms that are associated with sets. Here is a list down below.</p>
