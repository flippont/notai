<p>Trigonometric ratios are the ratios of the lengths of sides of a right-angled triangle. There are three types of
    trigonometric ratios.</p>
<p>The three sides of a right angled triangle is called the hypotenuse (the longest side), the adjacent (The side that
    is next to a given angle) and the opposite (The side that is the opposite to a given angle)</p>
<h2>The Sine (sin)</h2>
<p>Sin(θ) is the <strong>height</strong> of a triangle, where the <strong>hypotenuse</strong> is length 1 and the angle
    is equal to x degrees. For example, sin (10) is equal to 0.173, because the height of a right-angled triangle where
    the angle is 10 degrees, and the hypotenuse length is 1 is equal to 0.173. When you want to apply it to a triangle
    where the hypotenuse is larger or smaller than 1, you multiply the sin(x) by the hypotenuse.</p>
<p>Hence, the formula would be:</p>
<p>Sin θ = Opposite/Hypotenuse</p>
<h2>The Cosine (cos)</h2>
<p>cos(θ) is the <strong>base</strong> of a triangle, where the <strong>hypotenuse</strong> is length 1 and the angle is
    equal to x degrees. For example, cos (10) is equal to 0.984, because the base of a right-angled triangle where the
    angle is 10 degrees, and the hypotenuse length is 1 is equal to 0.984. When you want to apply it to a triangle where
    the hypotenuse is larger or smaller than 1, you multiply the cos(θ) by the hypotenuse.</p>
<p>Hence, the formula would be:</p>
<p>Cos θ = Adjacent/Hypotenuse</p>
<h2>The Tangent (tan)</h2>
<p>tan(θ) is the <strong>height</strong> of a triangle, where the <strong>adjacent</strong> is length 1 and the angle is
    equal to x degrees. For example, tan (10) is equal to 0.176, because the height of a right-angled triangle where the
    angle is 10 degrees, and the adjacent length is 1 is equal to 0.176. When you want to apply it to a triangle where
    the adjacent is larger or smaller than 1, you multiply the tan(θ) by the adjacent.</p>
<p>Hence, the formula would be:</p>
<p>Tan θ = Opposite/Adjacent</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The formulas are often remembered with SOHCAHTOA standing for each of the first letters in the element.</p>
<p>The theory of Pythagoras states that</p>
<p>(the adjacent)<sup>2</sup> + (the opposite)<sup>2</sup> = (the hypotenuse)<sup>2 </sup></p>
<p>So (sin θ)<sup>2</sup> + (cos θ)<sup>2</sup> = 1</p>
<h2>Trigonometric Functions</h2>
<p>Trigonometric functions are functions y = sin θ, y = cos θ, and y = tan θ.</p>
<p>Here is the graph for the function y = sin θ</p>

<p><br /> As you can see, the sin (θ) increases as the angle gets larger, until it hits 90°, where it starts to
    decrease.</p>
