<p>Algebraic Equations are equations that have letters in them, like a + 12, 10 × b, or x + y + z.</p>
<p>These letters are called variables, which represent another number.</p>
<p>For example, when you have “x” number of apples and 12 bananas, the total number of apples and bananas are x + 12.
</p>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>There are a few rules to follow when thinking about algebraic equations.</p>
<p>Rule 1: Abbreviate the × symbol when multiplying (E.g., a × b = ab)<br /> Rule 2: Abbreviate the 1 when multiplying
    by 1 (E.g., 1 × a = a)<br /> Rule 3: Abbreviate the 1 and add a - when multiplying by -1 (E.g., -1 × a = -a)<br />
    Rule 4: when multiplying a number by a variable, the number comes first (E.g., a × 4 = 4a)</p>
<p>For example, if you have x number of 2-euro coins and y number of 1-euro coins, the total amount of money would be
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The total amount of 2-euro coins, which is 2 × x or 2x (Rule 1, Rule 3), plus</li>
    <li>The total amount of 1-euro coins, which is 1 × y or y (Rule 2)</li>
</ul>
<p>Which is 2x + y.</p>
