<p>Expanding brackets involves multiplying every term inside the bracket by the term that is outside of the bracket.</p>
<p>When you want to expand a single bracket the formula you use is</p>
<p>a(b + c) = ab + ac</p>
<p>The formula for expanding multiple brackets is</p>
<p>(a + b) (c + d)<br /> = a(c + d) + b(c + d)<br /> = ac + ad + bc + bd</p>
<p>This is process is the same as the <strong>distributive law</strong>.</p>
<p>The distributive law is a law in maths, where: for natural numbers A, x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>…x<sub>n</sub> you
    can say -</p>
<p><em>Ax<sub>1</sub> + Ax<sub>2</sub> + Ax<sub>3</sub> + … + Ax<sub>n</sub> = A(x<sub>1</sub> + x<sub>2</sub> +
        x<sub>3</sub> + … + x<sub>n</sub>)</em></p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p><em>6 × 3 + 6 × 7 + 6 × 10<br /> = 6 × (3 + 7 + 10)<br /> = 6 × (20)<br /> = 120</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Factorising is the opposite of expanding brackets, where you multiply out a bracket to find the answer, and is used
    to solve quadratic equations.</p>
<p>There are mainly 4 ways to factorise an equation (Grouping, Highest Common factor, Quadratic and Difference of two
    squares).</p>
<h2>Highest Common factor</h2>
<p>The Highest common factor of two or more numbers / monomials is the product of all their common factors. For example,
    the highest common factor of 8x and 4x is 4x.</p>
<p>Using this, we can use the distributive law to factor out the common factor.</p>
<p>In the equation 4x + 8x, the common factor is 4x, so if we factor that out we get 4x ×  (1 + 2) or 4x(1 + 2).</p>
<h2>Grouping</h2>
<p>After finding the highest common factor, we can sometimes be left with a situation where we can further use the
    distributive law. This is called grouping.</p>
<p>For example, when we have the equation –</p>
<p><em>ab + ay + xb + xy</em></p>
<p>and find the highest common factor for all terms, we are left with -</p>
<p><em>a (b + y) + x (b + y)</em></p>
<p>As you can see, both terms have (b + y) included, so you can treat that as a highest common factor and factor out b +
    y from the full equation.</p>
<p>If we do that, we are left with -</p>
<p><em>(a + x) (x + y)</em></p>
<p>This is the principle of Grouping.</p>
<p>Quadratic<br /> A quadratic is a polynomial that is in the form of</p>
<p><em>ax<sup>2 </sup>+ bx + c</em></p>
<p>where a is the coefficient (Number in front) of x<em><sup>2</sup></em>, b is the coefficient of the x and the c is
    the constant (Number on its own). We will use 2x<sup>2</sup> + 5x + 3 as an example.</p>
<p>There are a few steps involved in factorising a quadratic.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Multiply a and c and write out the factors of (<em>c × a</em>), which we will now call “<em>m</em>”<br /> <em>m
            = 6</em></li>
    <li>Find a pair of factors that add together to make b, the middle number and multiply to get m.<br /> 3 + 2 = 5 =
        b, 3 * 2 = 6 = m</li>
    <li>Go back to the original polynomial, and now split the middle term into the two factors we found in step 2.<br />
        2x<sup>2</sup> + 2x + 3x + 3</li>
    <li>Now group the four sets of terms.<br /> 2x(x + 2) + 3 (x + 1) = (2x + 3)(x + 1)</li>
</ol>
<h2>DOTS</h2>
<p>Difference Of Two Squares, or DOTS is a method of factorising that works in a very specific case, when an expression
    is made up of the difference of two perfect squares, i.e. a<sup>2 </sup>+ b<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Then we can factor it as (a + b) (a - b).</p>
<p>For example, x<sup>2 </sup>– 36 can be factorised as (x + 6) (x - 6)</p>
