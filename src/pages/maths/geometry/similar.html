<p>Similar triangles are two triangles with the same shape but different sizes.</p>
<p>These triangles have a set of rules that they follow</p>
<ol>
    <li>All corresponding angles in the two triangles are equal</li>
    <li>The ratio between all of the corresponding sides are the same</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, if you have two similar triangles with side lengths a, b, c, and a<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>1</sub> and
    c<sub>1</sub>, you can say that -</p>
<p>a/a<sub>1</sub> = b/b<sub>1</sub> = c/c<sub>1 </sub></p>
<p>There are three ways to test for similar triangles.</p>
<ul>
    <li>AA – If 2 corresponding angles are equal (Angle Angle)</li>
    <li>SAS – If 2 pairs corresponding angle have the same ratio and the angle in between them are equal.</li>
    <li>SSS – If 3 corresponding sides have the same ratio.</li>
</ul>
