<p>Congruent triangles are two completely identical triangles that fit perfectly inside of one another. If a triangle is
    congruent, then they are also similar.</p>
<p>There are four tests for congruency.</p>
<ol>
    <li>SSS – When all three corresponding sides are equal in length (Side Side Side)</li>
    <li>SAS – When two corresponding sides are equal, and the corresponding angle between them are equal. (Side Angle
        Side)</li>
    <li>ASA – When two corresponding angles are equal, and another corresponding side is equal. (Angle Side Angle)</li>
    <li>HS – A pair of hypotenuses and another pair of corresponding sides are equal in two right angled triangles
        (Hypotenuse Side)</li>
</ol>
