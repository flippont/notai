    <li>Rince Burette, ipette and conical flask with deionised water.</li>
    <li>Rince Burette and pipette with solution they will contain (usually acids in butette )</li>
    <li>Pipette 25cm^3 of base into conical flask</li>
    <li>Add a few drops of indicator to conical flask</li>
    <li>Fill burette with acid at eye level using a funnel to above the zero mark and remove the funnel</li>
    <li>Open the tap to bring the level of acid down until the bottom of meniscus is level with the graduation mark.
        Look at eye level. * this also fills tap and space below with acid.</li>
    <li>Place conical flask on white tile - to see colour change.</li>
    <li>Open the tap to add acid to conical flask, swirling the flask and occasionally washing down the sides of flask
        with was bottle of deionised water.</li>
    <li>Carry out titration until a colour change is visible.</li>
    <li>One rough and two accutate titrations are carried out.</li>
