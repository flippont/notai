Checking if a verb is a caol(slender) verb or a leathan(broad) verb is really important in Irish, since it is vital in conjugating any regular / irregular verb in any of the four tenses. It is also necessary to know for one of the only rules in Irish spelling: Slender with slender, broad with broad</br>
To do this, you first check the last vowel in a verb after you treat it.</br>
This means that you need to remove aigh/igh or the last vowel if it is nessasary to do so before seeing if it is caol/leathan.
If the verb is an <b>a, o, or u</b> then it is broad (leathan)</br>
If the verb is an <b>i or an e</b> then it is slender (caol)</br>
For example, the last vowel of "Cuir" is an i, which is slender, so "Cuir" is a Caol verb.

<b>Caol le Caol, Leathan le leathan (Slender with Slender, Broad with Broad)</b></br>
Now to talk about the elephant in the room. Caol le Caol, Leathan le leathan is basically the only good rule in Irish spelling.</br>
It states that vowels that go on either side of a consonant or group of consonants, must agree. So if a caol vowel is on one side of a consonant, and a leathan vowel is on another, you've made a spelling mistake.
This is an amazing indicator for when you're looking for spelling mistakes.
