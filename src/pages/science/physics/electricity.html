
Electricity is the result of the movement of electrons, which have a negative charge. In a conductor the outer electrons on the atom to move freely, and allows charge to pass through it. When charge passes through a conductor, it is known as current electricity.  </br>

(I) is the symbol for Current electricity, and its unit is the ampere (A). It is measured with an ammeter.  </br>

The opposite of a conductor is an insulator, and electrons are not free to move, and does not allow charge to pass through it. Regardless of this, insulators can still be charged with static electricity. When two insulators rub with each other, electrons can pass from one another. This is called static electricity. When one object has more electrons than protons, it is negatively charged, and when an object has more protons than electrons, it is positively charged. </br>

<b>An electric field</b> is an area of space that is around a charged object/particle. Charged forces attract when they are opposite charges (+-/-+) and repel when they are the same (++/--). </br>
</br>

<b>Potential difference</b> or Voltage is the amount of energy that is needed to move a charge against an electric field.  </br>
(V) is the symbol for voltage and its unit is the volt (V). It is measured with a voltmeter. </br>
</br>

<b>Resistance</b> is the ability of a certain body to oppose the flow of charge. </br>

(R) is the symbol for resistance and its unit is the ohm (â„¦).  </br>

<b>Ohm's law</b> is the law that states that voltage is proportionally related to currents. It's formula is  

$$V = {I \times R}$$

When \\(V\\) is volts, \\(R\\) is resistance and \\(I\\) is currents. </br>
</br>
<b>Electrical power</b> is the amount of electrical energy that is being converted / dissipated into other forms p/s.  </br>

(P) is the symbol for electrical power, and its unit is the watt (W). </br>

The formula for finding the electrical power is </br>

$$P = {I \times V}$$

When \(P\) is electrical power, \(I\) is volts and \(V\) is currents.
