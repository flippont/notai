
<b>Work</b> measures the energy transfer that happens when an object is moved with a force, and it is measured in <b>Joules</b> (J). The formula is 
$$W = {F \over D}$$

when \(W\) is work, \(F\) is force and \(D\) is distance </br>

<b>Energy</b> is the ability to do work, and it is, like work, measured in <b>joules</b> (J). The different forms of energy are: Kinetic, Potential (which includes elastic and gravitational), Heat, Light, Sound (which is caused by vibrations), Electrical, Chemical and magnetic. </br>

The principal of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be changed from one form, into another. </br>

<b>Dissipation</b> is a term that used to describe a way in which energy is wasted, by turning into less useful forms, like heat. </br>

<b>Power</b> is the amount of energy converted into another form of energy in a span of time, and it is measured in <b>watts</b> (w). The formula is </br>

$$P = {W \over t}$$

when \(P\) is power, \(W\) is the work done in joules and  \(t\) is time.
