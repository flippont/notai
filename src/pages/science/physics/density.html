Density is the mass per unit volume, or 
$$D = {M \over V}$$

Where \(D\) is density, \(M\) is mass and \(V\) is volume. 

The standard unit of density is the \(kg/m^3\). The density of water is \(1g/cm^3\), since mass is centred around water. 
Something will float on a fluid if it is less dense than the fluid, and vice versa. This tendency is known as buoyancy, which was discovered by Archimedes in his famous episode with the bath.
