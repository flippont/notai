<p>Force is the push or pull on an object with mass, which causes it to change its velocity, and it is usually measured
    with a newton balance.</p>

<p class="label">Newton balance</p>
<p>Forces can cause things to move, stop, speed up, slow down or change shape.</p>
<p>The unit of force is the <strong>newton</strong> (N). <br /> <strong>Weight</strong> is the force of gravity acting
    on an object, and on earth it is roughly calculated by multiplying the mass of an object and multiplying it by 10.
    It can change depending on what part of the universe you are in, compared to mass which is not influenced by
    gravitational pull.</p>
<p>Forces can be either balanced or unbalanced. Balanced forces have no motion as they cancel each other out.</p>
<p>For magnets, similar poles repel each other and opposite poles attract. Similarly for electric currents, opposite
    charges attract and similar charges repel.</p>
<p>There are four fundamental forces at work in the universe. The strong force, the weak force, the electromagnetic
    force, and the gravitational force.</p>
<p>Forces always occur in pairs. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction as stated in the
    newton&rsquo;s laws of motion.</p>
