<b>Speed</b> is the rate in which an object is moving. It is calculated with this formula

$$S = {D \over t}$$

when \(S\) is speed, \(D\) is distance and \(t\) is time. </br>

The standard unit for speed is the metre per second (\(m/s \) or \(ms^{-1}\)). <b>Terminal velocity</b> is the steady
speed achieved by an object falling through a gas/liquid. </br>

<b>Velocity</b> is the rate at which an object is moving, at a specific direction. It is calculated with

$$V = {D \over t}$$

when \(V\) is velocity, \(D\) is the distance in a given direction and \(t\) is time. </br>

When a body is speeding up, it is usually said to be accelerating. It is calculated with this formula </br>

$$A = {\delta V \over t}$$

when \(A\) is acceleration, \(\delta V\) is the change in velocity (Note: \(\delta \) shows a change in something) and
(\t\) is time. </br>

On earth, <b>air resistance</b> exists to slow bodies down. The faster you go, the stronger the air resistance becomes.
When you are in a vacuum with no air, any object regardless of their density will fall at the same rate. </br>
