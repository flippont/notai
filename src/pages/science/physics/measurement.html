<p>All scientists use the international system of measurement, <strong>SI</strong>, also known as the metric system.
    Here is a list of the basic units of measurements</p>
<ul>
    <li>The standard unit for length is the metre(m), where 1 metre is 100 centimetres or 1000 millimetres.</li>
    <li>The standard unit for mass is the kilogram(kg), where 1 kilogram is 1000 grams, or the mass of 1 litre of water.
    </li>
    <li>The standard unit for area is the metre squared(m<sup>2</sup>), where 1 metre squared is 10000 centimetres
        squared.</li>
    <li>The standard unit for volume is the cubic metre(m<sup>3</sup>), where 1 cubic metre is 1000000 cubic
        centimetres.</li>
    <li>The standard unit for temperature is the centigrade(&deg;C) or Kelvin(K). 0 Kelvin is centred around absolute
        zero, or the coldest temperature(-273.15&deg;C) and the centigrade is centred around water, so the boiling point
        of water will be 100&deg;C, and the melting point of ice will be 0&deg;C</li>
</ul>
<p>Many instruments are used to measure length, e.g., the <strong>Metre stick</strong>, the <strong>trundle
        wheel</strong>, and the <strong>Vernier calliper</strong>. The Vernier calliper is used measure the diameter of
    an object.</p>

<p>Mass is the amount of matter in a certain body. The main instrument to measure mass is the <strong>mass
        balance</strong>.</p>
<p>Area is the amount of surface something has. The equation for finding out the area of a surface is width &times;
    height. (e.g., area of rectangle with sides 2cm and 4cm will be 8cm<sup>2</sup>)</p>
<p>Volume is the amount of space something takes up. The equation for finding out the volume of a surface is width
    &times; height &times; depth. (e.g., volume of cuboid with sides 2cm, 3cm and 4cm will be 24cm<sup>3</sup>). The
    volume of a liquid is found using a <strong>graduated cylinder</strong>.</p>
<p>Temperature is usually measured with a <strong>thermometer</strong>.</p>
<p>The different types of errors that can occur with measurements are:</p>
<p>Parallax errors, where a measurement looks like it&rsquo;s a different reading depending on what direction you look
    at it from, zero errors, where an instrument gives a reading when it is meant to be zero, and reaction time errors,
    where you have a different reaction time every time you conduct the experiment, resulting in a biased test.</p>
