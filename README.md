# Redact
Redact is a learning resource made over TY as a hobby project. It is a complilation of notes and tests made by a variety of people</br>
All the notes that are on the website are triple checked, but regardless there are bound to be errors. If any such errors are found, please create a pull request on the [Github Repository](https://github.com/flippont/redact)

You are free to do whatever with the notes provided, and I will be open to any suggestions regarding the website :)
If I don't respond to anything, I've probably just gone fishin'

### Disclaimer

The code is likely rather buggy, and the search isn't resistant to badly formed inputs at all. 

It's surprisingly fast considering it's caching so much data, but I call it good for now. It works well enough for the demo, and that's all I need.

### Requirements
* A computer / calculator - (A CASIO one will do)
* A modern browser - (try not to use firefox because it slows things down)

### How To Use
You navigate the tree of files by clicking on the bars with the multi-coloured tip. These bars will fill up with a light green to show your progress on the website (A.K.A, how many articles you've read).

The current page that you are on is shown on the bottom left as a series of links. You can click on one of these links to move back to a specific place. 

Some articles have a test / quiz built into them, and you can access them through a button that says 'Take test' in big friendly letters. You can click on the links in the Table of contents, where you will jump to that segment of the page.
You can save an article by clicking on the star on the article. Saved articles will appear on the home page.

Filtering etc... is pretty self explanatory. Fuzzy search is not implemented, so always remember to look out for typos.
